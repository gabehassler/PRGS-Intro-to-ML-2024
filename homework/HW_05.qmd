## Preparation

1. We're using the same [data file](https://github.com/gabehassler/PRGS-Intro-to-ML-2024/blob/main/data/processed/svi_covid.csv) from GitHub as the last assignment.
If should be in the _data/processed_ folder.



## Homework - Neural Newtorks

1. Use a simple neural network to predict the number of per-capita COVID-19 deaths in each county in the US using the SVI variables.
The outcome variable is `total_deaths_per_100k` and the predictor variables are `EP_POV150, EP_UNEMP, EP_HBURD, EP_NOHSDP, EP_UNINSUR, EP_AGE65, EP_AGE17, EP_DISABL, EP_SNGPNT, EP_LIMENG, EP_MINRTY, EP_MUNIT, EP_MOBILE, EP_CROWD, EP_NOVEH, EP_GROUPQ, EP_NOINT`.
The neural network should have one hidden layer with 10 nodes and use the ReLU activation function.
Plot the predicted values against the true values.
What is the mean squared error of the predictions in the test set?

2. Repeat the analysis from the previous question, but this time use a more complicated neural network with more hidden layers and/or more nodes in the hidden layers.
You should experiment with different architectures and activation functions to see what works best.
Plot the predicted values against the true values.
What is the mean squared error of the predictions in the test set?

3. Compare the predictions of the neural network in Question 2 to the predictions of the regression tree from the previous assignment. Which model would you use to predict the number of per-capita COVID-19 deaths? Why?
Which model would you use to understand the relationship between the SVI variables and the number of per-capita COVID-19 deaths? Why?
