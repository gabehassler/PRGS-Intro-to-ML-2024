__Question 1:__ Let $X$ be a Uniform(0, 1) random variable and let $Y = X^3 + X^2 + X$. Write a function that estimates the mean and variance of $Y$ using Monte Carlo simulation.
Your function should take as input the number of simulations to run and return the estimated mean and variance of $Y$.

# Your code here

```

__Question 2:__ Test the function above with 10,000 simulations. What are the estimated mean and variance of $Y$?

```{julia}
# Your code here
```

__Question 3:__ Time how long it takes to run the function above with 10,000; 100,000; 1,000,000; and 10,000,000 simulations. Display a table or data frame with columns corresponding to the number of simulations, the time it took to run them (in seconds), and the number of simulations per second.
