# PRGS-Intro-to-ML-2024

## Homework

I will post homework assignments in the _homework_ folder of this GitHub repository (repo).
Each of you will have your own repository where you will store your code for this class and submit your homework.
In order to complete and submit homework, you will need the following:

* A GitHub account
* _git_ installed on your computer
* A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, R Studio)
* At least one relevant programming language (e.g., Python, R, Julia) installed on your computer
* Programming notebooks (e.g., Jupyter, R Markdown, Quarto) installed on your computer or in your code editor

### Instructions

Each week:

1. Check out the 'develop' branch of your repo.
2. Create a notebook file (either Jupyter, R Markdown, or Quarto) in your 'homework' folder with file header "HW_XX" where "XX" is the homework number.
    * For example, if you use Jupyter, then you would create a file called "HW_01.ipynb" for the first homework assignment.
    * If I post the assignment as a notebook, then you can use that notebook as your starting point.
4. Commit the initial version of your notebook to the 'develop' branch.
5. Complete the assignment.
    * For longer assignments, I recommend committing your work periodically to the 'develop' branch.
    * Don't commit the HTML output in your develop branch.
6. Merge the 'develop' branch into the 'main' branch.
7. Commit the compiled HTML notebook output to the 'main' branch.
8. Push your changes to your GitHub repo.
