# PRGS-Intro-to-ML-2024

## Setup

Before class on Wednesday, October 9, I would like you to:

* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer
* Install a code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)) on your computer
    * I will be using VS Code for demonstrations in class
* Install at least one relevant programming language (e.g., [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/)) on your computer
    * I will use all three languages for demonstrations in class.
    * If you are using VS Code, you should install the relevant [extension(s)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
* Install a programming notebooks (e.g., [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)) on your computer or in your code editor
    * I will use Quarto for demonstrations in class.
    * R Markdown is built into R Studio.
    * If using VS Code, you should install the relevant [extension(s)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
* Write and compile a simple notebook file in your code editor
    * I don't care about the content, just make sure you execute at least one line of code.
    * If you are using Jupyter, you can use the [Jupyter Notebook Quick Start Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to get started.
    * If you are using R Markdown, you can use the [R Markdown Quick Start Guide](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) to get started.
    * If you are using Quarto, you can use the [Quarto Quick Start Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to get started.
* Create a GitHub account
* Create a GitHub repository for this class
    * You'll want to initialize the repository with a README file (this is one of the options when you create the repository)
    * Either make sure your repository is public or add [me](https://github.com/gabehassler) as a collaborator
    * You may name your repository whatever you like, but I recommend something like "PRGS-Intro-to-ML-2024"
* Add the link to your GitHub repository in this [Excel sheet](https://randus.sharepoint.com/sites/560IntroductiontoMachineLearningAY2024-25FallQuarter/Shared%20Documents/General/Miscellaneous/GitHub%20Repos.xlsx?d=w4f2c7ccb42bb4dceb0a204f7d8a6903e&csf=1&web=1&e=VVSDp7) on the class Teams page.


## Homework

I will post homework assignments in the _homework_ folder of this GitHub repository (repo).
Each of you will have your own repository where you will store your code for this class and submit your homework.
<!-- In order to complete and submit homework, you will need the following:

* A GitHub account
* _git_ installed on your computer
* A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, R Studio)
* At least one relevant programming language (e.g., Python, R, Julia) installed on your computer
* Programming notebooks (e.g., Jupyter, R Markdown, Quarto) installed on your computer or in your code editor -->

### Instructions

Each week:

1. Check out the 'develop' branch of your repo.
2. Create a notebook file (either Jupyter, R Markdown, or Quarto) in your 'homework' folder with file header "HW_XX" where "XX" is the homework number.
    * For example, if you use Jupyter, then you would create a file called "HW_01.ipynb" for the first homework assignment.
    * I will typically post the homework as a Quarto markdown document ('.qmd'). You may use that document directly as a starting point. If your are using another document format, make sure that all instructions are included with your final submission.
4. Commit the initial version of your notebook to the 'develop' branch.
5. Complete the assignment.
    * For longer assignments, I recommend committing your work periodically to the 'develop' branch.
    * Don't commit the HTML output in your develop branch.
6. Merge the 'develop' branch into the 'main' branch.
7. Commit the compiled HTML notebook output to the 'main' branch.
8. Push your changes to your GitHub repo.
