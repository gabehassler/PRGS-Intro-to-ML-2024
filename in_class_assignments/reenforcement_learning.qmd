## Rock-Paper-Scissors

While many people thing that Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game of chance, there are cognitive biases that can be exploited to win more often.
In this activity, you will implement a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game and a simple strategy to exploit a cognitive bias.

I have written code the implements a simplefied version of how humans (on average) play rock paper scissors.

```{python}

import random

OPTIONS = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

# basic rules of the game
def points(player, opponent):
    if player == opponent:
        return 0
    if player == "rock" and opponent == "scissors":
        return 1
    if player == "scissors" and opponent == "paper":
        return 1
    if player == "paper" and opponent == "rock":
        return 1
    return -1

# basic rules of the game
def beats_move(move):
    if move == "rock":
        return "paper"
    if move == "paper":
        return "scissors"
    if move == "scissors":
        return "rock"
    return None

# create the weighted probability vector
def biased_move(ind, bias):
    vec = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    for (i, v) in enumerate(vec):
        if i == ind:
            vec[i] = 1 / 3 + bias
        else:
            vec[i] = 1 / 3 - bias / 2
    return vec

# determine how a player will play based on their last move and the last move of their opponent
def human_player(last_move, last_opponent_move, bias = 0.33):
    points_last = points(last_move, last_opponent_move)
    if points_last == 1: # player won last round
        ind = OPTIONS.index(last_move) # more likely to play the same move
    elif points_last == -1: # player lost last round
        ind = OPTIONS.index(beats_move(last_opponent_move)) # more likely to play the move that beats the opponent's last move
    else: # player tied last round
        ind = OPTIONS.index(last_move)
        bias = -bias / 2 # player is less likely to play the same move
    
    wv = biased_move(ind, bias)
    return random.choices(OPTIONS, weights = wv)[0]

```

## Task
Program a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows a human to play against the computer.
The computer will use the `human_player` function to determine its move.
Use reenforcement learning to train the computer to play optimally against the `human_player` function.
The state space is the last move of the player and the last move of the opponent.
